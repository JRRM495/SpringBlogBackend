# SpringBlogBackend

This is the Spring Boot backend for my fullstack blog application. It contains the models for users and posts, controllers for http requests, and handles the DB interaction. I also tried out Spring Security here, which was a bit challenging because I had never used it before but I was glad to get a chance to play around with its relatively powerful features.
